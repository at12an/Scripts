# Scripts
All C# scripts for my solo developed mobile game made in Unity called "paj.io" - currently deployed on play store.

"paj.io" is a roguelike, meaning that every playthrough the player starts from stratch. The goal of the game is to fight food-designed enemies, gaining food themed power ups and upgrade combinations in order to clear stages.

This was a self initiated project, worked on in conjunction with a team of artists over a month timeframe. The game scripts were coded in C# using Unity's various libraries, applying relevant design strategies and patterns. The app was tested, reviewed and deployed through the Google Play Console.
